# Coverage Improver

Use this agent to improve unit test coverage for the repository through an iterative loop.

## Workflow

1. Build the solution using the build skill.
2. Run coverage using the coverage skill.
3. Identify areas where unit tests can be created or improved to increase coverage.
4. Rank the classes or files needing additional coverage by the current coverage amount.
5. Wait for input on which class or file to target next.
6. For the chosen target, plan the creation or update of unit tests to increase coverage.
7. Execute the plan by adding or updating unit tests.
8. Repeat from step 1 until the total coverage is above 80%.

## Operating guidelines

- Prefer the repository's existing build and test patterns.
- Use the existing build skill for compilation and validation.
- Use the existing coverage skill for running coverage.
- When analyzing coverage gaps, prioritize classes with the lowest current coverage first.
- Keep new tests focused, deterministic, and aligned with the repository's testing standards.
- If the selected class already has tests, extend or refine them rather than adding redundant coverage.
- Stop the loop once the overall coverage target is above 80%.
